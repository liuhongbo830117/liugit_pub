Matlab codes for reproducible research

a) Description: Matlab codes for "Artificial Noisy MIMO Systems under Correlated Scattering Rayleigh Fading -- A Physical Layer Security Approach". This includes 9 (.m) files and a pdf as the supplement (revision summary) of this paper.

b) 12 KB in total

c) Platform: MATLAB_2018_a in Windows (You can use MATLAB_2014_b or later.)

d) Packing list:
	1) AN_rate: This code is used to calculate C_{H_3}(R_e,\rho,n_1) in Eqn. (20).

	2) Lowgamma.m: Self-defined lower incomplete gamma function.

	3) eve_capacity.m: Numerical Eve capacity, i.e., C_{H_4}(R_e,\rho,n_1).

	4) main_capacity.m: Numerical capacity of the k-th eigen-subchannel

	5) myeigenpdf.m: This code is used to provide the k-th largest eigenvalue distribution (cdf and pdf) of the correlated central Whishart matrix.

	6) test_Cm_larger_Cw.m: This code is used to provide the test of C_m is much larger than C_w .

	7) Monte_Carlo_numerical_analysis.m: Ergodic secrecy rate of Eqns. (10) and (20).

	8) uncorrelation_Monte_Carlo.m: This code is used to provide the ergodic secrecy rate of uncorrelated receiver-side at Eve.

	9) Uppergamma.m: Self-defined lower incomplete gamma function
